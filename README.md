#  Introduction 
This project aims to provide a small dynamic website to contain data for a spring ski trip amongst friends. 
For now the aim is a bare bones website; no login, no authentication, no rate limiting, prone to DDOS and slightly unsafe.
I doubt the users would ever extend past friends but if it turns out to be useful I will add more safety features. 

## Tech Stack 
- React, Tailwind CSS frontend
- Node Backend
- MongoDB Database

## Tips
To run `fnm` environment for node and `npm` use this following command:
```bash
fnm env --use-on-cd | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```
